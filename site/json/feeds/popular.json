When will liberals take responsibility for their own personal actions and stop blaming everyone around them for the worlds problems? Stop blaming inanimate objects and cyber space for the actions of insane people who commit horrific acts of violence in the real world. @a needs to stay the course and fight these people with everything he has. He also needs our support. This is a liberal media take down of @Gab occurring in real time. These liberals simply will not live and let live or leave good people alone. This is not an alt-right or Nazi website. This is not a den of hate. This is a free speech website, that is all. Think about how badly these sick people want to control everything. Think about how hard they attack free speech and anything that is different from the narrative they spew 24/7. Today is a very important date in the history of Gab and will be benchmarked as the day Gabbers fought back against the insanity of liberal media and the lies they tell the world without punishment. This is not a call to violence in any way. This is a call for action to get your voice heard and illuminate the lies of the left. Now is the time to make a stand and say no more of this bullshit. It is time to brainstorm ideas and come up with a plan. We are 800K strong. Andrew, how can we help? #Gab #GabFam",

When will liberals take responsibility for their own personal actions and stop blaming everyone around them for the worlds problems? Stop blaming inanimate objects and cyber space for the actions of insane people who commit horrific acts of violence in the real world. @a needs to stay the course and fight these people with everything he has. He also needs our support. This is a liberal media take down of @Gab occurring in real time. These liberals simply will not live and let live or leave good people alone. This is not an alt-right or Nazi website. This is not a den of hate. This is a free speech website, that is all. Think about how badly these sick people want to control everything. Think about how hard they attack free speech and anything that is different from the narrative they spew 24/7. Today is a very important date in the history of Gab and will be benchmarked as the day Gabbers fought back against the insanity of liberal media and the lies they tell the world without punishment. This is not a call to violence in any way. This is a call for action to get your voice heard and illuminate the lies of the left. Now is the time to make a stand and say no more of this bullshit. It is time to brainstorm ideas and come up with a plan. We are 800K strong. Andrew, how can we help? #Gab #GabFam",
