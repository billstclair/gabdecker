<p>I set up a <a href='https://mewe.com/join/gabhaven'>Gab Haven</a> group on MeWe, as a temporary gathering place, during outages.</p>

<p><a href='https://gab.com/'>Gab.com</a> starting late on 28 October, 2018:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors. We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh. Gab will continue to fight for the fundamental human right to speak freely.</p>

<p>As we transition to a new hosting provider Gab will be inaccessible for a period of time. We are working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. Thank you and remember to speak freely.</p>

<blockquote><p>New hosting provider secured. Working around the clock to see to it that Gab.com stays online. You can't stop the power of The People in their fight for freedom and liberty against tyranny.</p>

<p>FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.</p>

<blockquote><p>Breaking: @joyent, Gab's new hosting provider, has just pulled our hosting service. They have given us until 9am on Monday to find a solution. Gab will likely be down for weeks because of this. Working on solutions. We will never give up on defending free speech for all people.</p>
